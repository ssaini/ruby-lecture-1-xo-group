# Assignment

# Write an if statement with 3 different branches
#   use !=, ==, and > in those branches

# Assign a variable based on the result of an if statement

# Execute code based on the result of an if statement.
#   conditionally run puts "Hello Class" if 1 < 2

# Try using an if statement at the end of an expression
